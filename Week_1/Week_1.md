- Should have started this 2 days before but due to some personal issues wasn't able to get started. Today didn't do much except just wanted to get started and I have already spent a week on learning Javascript couple of months before so was revisiting those notes. 
- Set up the github repo and have to learn how to use git commands ðŸ˜….
- Already have so much going on machine learning area, trying to find a right balance between these two. 
- Didn't studied much but went through the materials and coded few lines of js for instance, 
   - Different data types available (7 types) 
   - Every value in js is either Object or Primitive. 
   - Learnt how dynamic typing works in js where data types of values are automatically defined.
