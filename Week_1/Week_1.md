![Day 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashikshafi08/100daysofJS/main/Week_1/images/Screenshot%202021-05-24%20at%209.00.36%20PM.png)
- Should have started this 2 days before but due to some personal issues wasn't able to get started. Today didn't do much except just wanted to get started and I have already spent a week on learning Javascript couple of months before so was revisiting those notes. 
- Set up the github repo and have to learn how to use git commands ðŸ˜….
- Already have so much going on machine learning area, trying to find a right balance between these two. 
- Didn't studied much but went through the materials and coded few lines of js for instance, 
   - Different data types available (7 types) 
   - Every value in js is either Object or Primitive. 
   - Learnt how dynamic typing works in js where data types of values are automatically defined. 

**Day 2**
Today had the thoughts of giving up this challenge because it's hard to manage 3-4 tasks at everyday, almost felt like a burnout. But wanted to push myself till I get shattered and realize things. 
- Didn't code much today it was me revisiting the old notes and recalling things. 
- Working on multiple things so it will take time for me to plan accordingly till that I wanna survive. 
- Learnt about `let` , `const` and `var` when to use and when not to use them. 
- `let` --> Common one we will run into. Can be used at the place after assigning there will be some changes made to that later in the program. Re-assigning is possible (or) we can mutate the variable. 
- `const` --> It can't be changed or mutated so once defined it remains the same. And `var` is avoidable since it's a old way of defining a variable.
- Went through some basic operators in Javascript.
