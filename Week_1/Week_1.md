# Week 1 Logs 

**Day 1**
- Should have started this 2 days before but due to some personal issues wasn't able to get started. Today didn't do much except just wanted to get started and I have already spent a week on learning Javascript couple of months before so was revisiting those notes. 
- Set up the github repo and have to learn how to use git commands ðŸ˜….
- Already have so much going on machine learning area, trying to find a right balance between these two.
