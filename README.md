# ```100 days of JavaScript```

Hey guys, thank for you making to my repo. Here I will be posting my codes and notes of the  100 Days of code challenge focusing 80% on Javascript and rest has to be planned. The reason I started this is to start again with Web Development that I had quit years ago and went on learning machine learning. It's been a year and I wanted to give my shot again and see how it goes. 

Since I have previous knowledge on HTML and CSS wanted to really get comfortable with Javascript at first without distracting myself into any frameworks or libraries. And I love javascript personally writing those every syntax feels kinda relaxing somehow. Will update this description soon with more addons and stuff. Also planning to log my daily learnings into Anki.
